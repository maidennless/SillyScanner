Silly Port Scanner
#
<br>
<br>
This is a python script made to scan ports. It scans through all ports altogether displaying the results respectively.
Don't really need to install anything.
Just a quick script. No it does not rival nmap. Like I said, just a small script for learning puproses.
Can be made better. I'll leave that to you.

Script runs both ways.
